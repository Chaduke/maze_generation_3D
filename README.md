Maze generation was taken from Chapter 11 of the Recursion book at Invent With Python by Al Sweigart:

https://inventwithpython.com/recursion/chapter11.html

I then adapted it into 3D using LibSGD:

https://libsgd.org

To see this example in action do this:

```
git clone https://github.com/Chaduke/maze_generation_3D
cd maze_generation_3D
pip install libsgd
python main.py
```

Use WASD or the arrow keys to move around and Mouse to steer

This also gives you a decent demonstration of how to create a minimap.
